Mark,

      Yes, I will take a look on this and implement the centroid
computation for the Manhattan distance (the only one implemented in
Weka at the moment besides Euclidian if I'm not mistaken) and limit
the access to this two functions.
      And, I have no problem with copyright

Obs: your observation on the sum of squared errors is correct, I'll
use a Euclidian distance object for it independent of the function
used.


Regards,
Thiago
