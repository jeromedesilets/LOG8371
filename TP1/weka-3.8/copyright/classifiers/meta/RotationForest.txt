Subject: Re: Weka contribution

Dear Mark,


Thanks for including the method in weka.


Regarding the copyright, I accept if the copyright would be held  
jointly.
If you can sell a commercial license of weka, I give you permission to
include this method. Nevertheless, I'd like to remain as the author  
in the
source code.


Can I request a small change in the code of the method? It would be to
include in line 815 (of the snapshot) the following line:
	dataSubSet.randomize( random );

It doesn't affect the results for the default options, but it could be
useful if the filter or the base classifier do not implement  
Randomizable
but they have a random element (e.g., RandomProjections, a
FilteredClassifier with a Randomizable classifier).


There is an issue that affects a lot to the memory size of the  
classifiers
generated by the method, it is the implementation of  
PrincipalComponents.
This has already been discussed in the mailing list
(https://list.scms.waikato.ac.nz/mailman/htdig/wekalist/2008-October/ 
014918.html)

Apart from that issue, it would be very useful to include the line
     m_TrainInstances = null;
at line 704 (end of the setup method) of the PrincipalComponents  
filters.
Otherwise, the filter keeps a copy of the dataset.

Could you consider to make these changes in PrincipalComponents,  
please? I
think that these changes don't break anything, but I'm not completely
sure.


Best regards,
