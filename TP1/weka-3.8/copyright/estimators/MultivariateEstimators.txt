Mark
No prooblems, just wanted to make sure it gets into system to help others a=
s
have heard many people on the forum asking for it and even i needed to  use
it for my evolutionary stuff.
Yeah i am fine with any copyrights you have, my goal was more to help peopl=
e
as i got benefitted by WEKA and you, a lot. You can also change the code,
add yourself as author etc, have no qualms :-).
I implemented only the Normal Estimator for now as it was more
straightforward, but if i get chance will add kernel estimator too.
Take care
Uday
