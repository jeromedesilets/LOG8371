Hello again Mark!
Things are getting better now, finally we have made it. Now I am sending you
a new search strategy, it's about TabuSearch algorithm. I have tried to not
making the same mistakes that I made in ScatterSearch. I hope you help me
with this, making feedback. About your last request of giving copyright for
ScatterSearch to the University of Waikato; I agree, because you and Weka
deserve it. Thanks for all, and the best regards for you.
Adrian Pino.
